# Shine frontend for LLVM

An LLVM frontend for a simple language

## Pre-requirements

LLVM 9 needs to be installed to compile or interpret the IR generated by this compiler.

## Building the runtime

To build the runtime for the language, call

```
make
```

## Usage

Interpret
> ./run.sh examples/fibonacci.shi

Compile into executable and run it
> ./compile.sh examples/fibonacci.shi fibonacci

> ./fibonacci

## Language

Every script needs to end in an expression. The value of this expression is printed as the output of the program.

Example script:
```
fibonacci = (n) => if (n <= 2) 1 else fibonacci(n-2) + fibonacci(n-1)

fibonacci(40)
```
This prints out `102334155`
