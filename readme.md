# Shine frontend for LLVM

An LLVM frontend for a simple language

## Pre-requirements

LLVM 9 needs to be installed to compile or interpret the IR generated by this compiler.

## Usage

Interpret
> ./run.sh examples/functions.shi

Compile into executable and run it
> ./compile.sh examples/functions.shi > test

> chmod u+x test

> ./test

## Language

Every script needs to end in an expression. The value of this expression is printed as the output of the program.

Example script:
```
square = (x) => { x * x }
add = (x, y) => { x + y }
dist = (x, y) => { add(square(x), square(y)) }

dist(3, 4)
```
This prints out `25`
