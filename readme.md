# Shine frontend for LLVM

An LLVM frontend for a simple language

## Pre-requirements

LLVM 9 needs to be installed to compile or interpret the IR generated by this compiler.

## Usage

Interpret
> ./run.sh examples/functions.shi

Compile into executable and run it
> ./compile.sh examples/functions.shi > test

> chmod u+x test

> ./test

## Language

Every script needs to end in an expression. The value of this expression is printed as the output of the program.

Example script:
```
divisions_by_2 = (x) => {
    agg = (n, res) => { if (n % 2 == 0) agg(n / 2, res + 1) else res }
    agg(x, 0)
}

divisions_by_2(72)
```
This prints out `3`
